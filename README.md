# NodeJS-REST-API-EXPRESS-SEQUELIZE-MYSQL
API + DB + DIAGRAM + README + REQUESTS PDF

This is a NodeJS REST API with Express, Sequelize & MYSQL.

Nota bene : the app contains two .env, so it can be run in local, or with docker.

Read "Requests" pdf file to see postman's requests examples.

You can check the db_diagram to see how series.sql has been done.

Enjoy =)
